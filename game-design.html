            <p class="normalText">
              At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Scholar table.

            <p class="normalText">
              The Scholar table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these wizard spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
              <br><br>
              For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Burning Hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Burning Hands using either slot.

              When you complete a long rest, you may replace one of the wizard spells you know with another wizard spell of a level for which you have spell slots.

            <h3 class="subHeader">Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p class="normalText">
              Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to study and memorize the intricacies of magic. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
              <br><br>
              <u>Spell save DC</u> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

              You can use an arcane focus or your Primordial Quill as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

If I needed to pull some power away from the class, I would consider cutting this, but in truth I find the lack of Ritual Casting on some classes quite awkward thematically — what Warlock worth their salt doesn't perform an eldritch ritual to commune with their patron every now and then? That said, it's an easy thing to cut without hindering the rest of the class, so I'd say its up first on the chopping block for removal.">Ritual Casting</mark></h3>
            <p class="normalText">
              You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

            <h3 class="subHeader">Primordial Quill</h3>
            <p class="normalText">
              You carry a Primordial Quill which you can use a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
              Through your studies, you have learned to write powerful words of primordial power that manipulate the world around you. You can learn two Primordial Words in total and additional ones at levels 6 and 13. <br><br><mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="While these Primordial Words are powerful, they also have some disadvantages. First, you can only learn 4 in total from a list of 6, so some compromises have to be made. Your subclass gives you two additional ones flavored for it specifically, however. The number of charges (which are required to use the words) scales from 2-8, which means they are highly limited early on and become much more frequently available later on. This is intended to mirror the gain of spell slots; a utility spell at level 3 can be a heavy investment compared to later on when its hardly any cost to you.">Primordial Words</mark> are split into two categories: Glyphs and Incantations.
              <br><br>You require a charge to write a Glyph or speak an Incantation. You have a number of charges equal to your 2 + your Proficiency Bonus. You regain all charges when finishing a long rest.
              <br><br>At 1st Level, you gain access to <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Here is the first major disadvantage. The incantations (unlocked later) are much quicker to use, but these glyphs require a full minute, making them unviable in combat. The next class feature, Swiftwriting, exists to partially mitigate this downside. The purpose of this downside is to allow the glyphs to be quite powerful without becoming unbalanced in combat. ">Glyphs</mark>. Glyphs require 1 minute to write due to their intricacy, during which time you must remain focused and use your Primordial Quill to draw the glyph from memory. You may choose from the following Glyphs:
              <ul class="normalText">
                <li><u><mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Easily the weakest of the glyphs, and many players are likely to skip it. However, it does present some creative opportunities and provides an effect which isn't all that easy to replicate. Because the vision is one-way, it can be used for setting up an ambush, spying through a wall, and so on. More commonly, it can be used to peer into, say, the next room of the dungeon, giving the party a peek into what comes next. As a gift to any poor DM having their plans foiled by this glyph, it includes the thickness and non-anti-magical stipulations. If the glyph becomes a problem, the world can suddenly become filled with thick or enchanted walls to help keep things sane.">Glyph of Piercing Vision:</mark></u> When drawn onto a surface, this glyph can affect a circular area up to 5ft in radius. All creatures on the side of the surface on which the glyph was drawn can see through to the other side, provided that the surface is no more than 5ft thick and has no anti-magic properties. The glyph remains active for up to 1 hour and can be dismissed by the caster at will.</li>
                <li><u><mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="An incredibly powerful option in theory, held back a bit by the setup required. In playtesting, this ability was an absolute joy to use. The creative applications are off the charts, especially if your DM interprets the wall of force to be capable of supporting weight. It may be wise to explicitly specify this ala Tenser's Foating Disk, but I also somewhat prefer to leave that function of the ability to DM discretion. In any case, the combat uses are quite clear, though keep in mind that the player needs quite the tactical foresight or creative improvising to have the wall in the perfect position once combat gets rolling. The two different saves seems very awkward at first, but there is a reason behind it. While blocking projectiles is very useful, blocking movement is incredibly powerful, especially in 5e where movement is generally very free and forgiving. Intelligence Saving Throws are absolutely outstanding against most creatures, meaning requiring an Intelligence Save for them to pass through the wall would be utterly absurd. Con Saves are quite weak by comparison, which helps keep the effect from being overwhelming. Alternatively, the save could be switched to Int and we could specify a "once failed, the creater can pass through the wall without effect for 1hr afterwards" clause, which might be a better way to go.">Glyph of Warding Force:</mark></u> After being drawn onto a surface, this glyph can be activated by the caster as a Bonus Action or Reaction to create a wall of force up to 5ft in two directions and up to 15ft tall from the location the glyph was drawn on. The wall of force can only run along the surface, otherwise it will not appear. The wall persists for 1 minute. During that time, any creature which sends a projectile through the wall must make an Intelligence Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC to avoid having the projectile be destroyed on contact with the wall. In addition, any creature which attempts to pass through the wall must make a Constitution Saving Throw against Spell Save DC. If they fail the save, their speed becomes 0 until the start of their next turn, and are knocked prone.</li>
                <li><u><mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Hold Monster in a bottle, though a fairly clunky bottle to be fair. I can definitely see a change to making the effect only work on creatures smaller than Large rather than Large and smaller to help make it easier for a DM to adjust their enemy compositions should this ability become problematic. The Restrained effect is there to allow the DM to curb power by introducing immune enemies without the player feeling totally cheated. No effect at all would feel quite bad given the setup needed, so we meet them in the middle and let them halt movement for a bit if nothing else. It's also arguable to just make the effect Restrained in general. An alternate ability idea: Restrained effect for all creatures in the zone on activation. The caster can activate it as a Reaction whenever a creature moves into or within the radius. Intelligence Saving Throw to avoid the restrain so that the effect is more consistent.">Glyph of Anchoring:</mark></u> When a creature moves within 5ft of this glyph, the glyph activates, Paralyzing them for up to 1 minute. During that time, they can attempt a Wisdom Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target is immune to being Paralyzed or of a size greater than Large, they are instead Restrained for the same duration. You can specify any number of creatures to be immune to the glyph when you first draw it.</li>

              <div class="normalText">At 5th level, you gain access to Incantations. Incantations can be spoken at a moment's notice.</div>
              <ul class="normalText">
                <li>
                  <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A fairly common ability to many classes and subclasses, though I doubt anyone will complain about seeing it here. It's an ability which feels great to use, is balanced by the need for a Reaction and a charge of Primordial Quill, and helps deliver on the theme of controlling the universe through primordial magic.">Word of Shielding:</mark>As a Reaction when a creature you can see within 60ft of you is hit by an attack or spell attack, you utter a word of power and rewrite the brief period of history leading to the hit, forcing the attacker to reroll their attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="This could arguably require an action, potentially in place of a spell slot. Being able to cleanse spell effects is very powerful, especially on a class which doesn't especially need their bonus action for all that much else. However, at that point it suffers from being obsolete compared to Dispel Magic. I think keeping it as a bonus action is the right way to go, but a potential balancing lever is to simply make it touch range.">Word of Annuling:</mark>As a Bonus Action, select a creature you can see within 60ft
                  and utter a word of power that compels a spell or magical effect affecting them to end immediately. If the spell is of Spell Slot Level 3 or higher, you must expend a Spell Slot of equal level to end the effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="My personal favorite of the words and certainly the most unique as well. The uses are practically infinite, though they require some creativity to make use of. However, there are some obvious ones: namely turning armor and weapons intangible. The way the ability is written, a creature can only save one item, so a fully armed soldier would have to pick between sword and armor, for example. While this seems extremely powerful, Heat Metal effectively does the same thing in a slightly different manner as far as armored humanoids goes. I also forgot to include a range in the original document, but I settled on 60ft immediately after starting playtesting. An interesting use case that came up in playtesting was when an NPC had an item the party needed and was attempting to flee. The Scholar used Word of Intangibility on the item, forcing the NPC to leave it behind and run. ">Word of Intangibility:</mark>As a Bonus Action, select any number of objects within a 5ft cube and turn them intangible. This incantation can only affect objects weighing less than 50 pounds. Affected objects remain floating at the location they were at when the incantation was used. Creatures and other objects move through them as though they were not there. If an object is held by a creature, that creature may make a Dexterity Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC to avoid this effect on an item of their choice. The objects remain intangible for 1 minute or until you willingly end the effect at any point on your turn.

The &quot;almost any length&quot; is intentionally vague to leave room for DM discretion. A DM could easily rule for an exact number of words, sentences, pages, etc, though to be honest I don&#39;t see this ability proving very problematic.">Starting at 2nd level, your scholarly endeavors have trained you to write and read at an almost unnatural pace when needed. You are able to garner a summary of a text of almost any length near instantly. If you are able to spend at least 1 minute studying a text, image, speech, etc. then you can recall it with perfect accuracy for up to 1 month afterwards. </mark>

              <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="An extremely powerful ability combined with the glyphs above. You have to pick ahead of time and can only do it once until you rest again, but even still, this turns the glyphs into a powerful combat tool. I can definitely see changing this to an action instead, but at least at early levels playtesting showed it to be relatively tame. With the theme of the class being preparation, this ability drives that point home. You get a potentially very powerful effect once per short rest, but you need to plan ahead of time what you intend to do.">In addition, when finishing a short or long rest, you may choose one Glyph and prepare ahead of time to write it quickly when needed. When you write the prepared Glyph, you can choose to do so as a Bonus Action rather than the usual writing time.

I considered having a class feature that allowed the Scholar to observe as a bonus action whether a creature is in the hit points range to be succeptible to a Power Word spell, but I ultimately couldn't find a good place to put it and ended up just scrapping it. It could fit in in the Field of Death below as a replacement to one of the more game-breaking abilities in that subclass.">Starting at 18th level, you may learn Power Word: Stun or Power Word: Kill and always have that spell prepared.

You're unlikely to have high enough Charisma to really make this a useful effect unless you have literally no one else in the party that can handle your social interactions. In my limited high-level playtesting I tended to just use this ability for flavor, speaking in the language of the universe to show that I meant business.">In addition, you can communicate using Primeval Speech for up to 1 minute.

Note that this ability does not require a reaction, but can just be done at will. In my opinion, 20th level feats should be flavorful and cool first and foremost, especially since by this point there aren't all that many things that can truly present a radical threat to the party. That said, as a small measure of balance, Revision wouldn&#39;t, for example, act as a perfect substitute for Counterspell. Undoing the event means undoing the spell cast altogether, meaning that the creature retains charges/spell slots/etc. I suppose technically by the feature description they don't necessarily lose their action if they used it either, but I think any group is likely to rule that the creature can't just perform another action afterwards. It could be wise to explicitly state all of this in the ability description, though that's a relatively minor thing given than most games will never get to this ability anyway.">Revision</mark></h3>

                This is a League of Legends character idea designed for the support role. Balance not included. 
                <br><br>For some abilities, I provide alternate ideas that I've considered alongside the main ones. Design comments (on highlighted portions) help explain my reasoning.
              </p>
  
              <h3 class="subHeader">Passive - Conduit</h3>
              <p class="normalText">
                <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="One of two ways to generate Charge (see below) This also provides a tiny bit of peel with the slow (which with the E is enough to get by) and gives a cool sense of synergy between the character and whoever they're working with. This idea appears in the ultimate as well and with Supercharged as a mechanic: pick an ally you trust, power them up, and start murdering people. The attack range should be fine tuned to avoid being impossible to avoid in lane. Ideally, the enemies should need to be conscious of not making it too easy for the character to gain Charge, and the extended range might undermine that if overtuned."><u>Draining Touch:</u></mark> When not on cooldown, your next basic attack gains extended range (roughly 450 units) and drains the target, slowing them briefly, granting you 1 Charge, and Marking them for a few seconds. If an ally damages a Marked enemy, the enemy takes an additional burst of damage.
                <br><br><i>Cooldown: Low-Moderate (Roughly 16-8s, scaling with level)</i>
                <br><br>
                <u>Charge:</u> You can store up to 4 Charge at a time. Charge persists while out of combat. When you have 4 Charge stored, your next cast of Surge [or the alternate ability Reinforce] is empowered.
                <br><br>
                <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Both you and an ally get this buff, encouraging you both to go crazy while it lasts. The duration is short, but can be extended indefinitely as long as you keep landing attacks. During the duration, you can constantly apply the damage mark from Draining Touch for your Supercharged ally to take advantage of. (Any ally can do it, but your friend with boosted attack and movement speed should be more than capable. We don&#39;t want to restrict it to Supercharged allies only since that would make it useless when you aren&#39;t Supercharged.)

                Ideally, enemies should be able to outspace Supercharged characters and let the buff run out. In practice, this should be quite difficult, but possible especially if CC is used. The duration (or the refresh amount) should be tinkered with to make this a possibility."><u>Supercharged:</u></mark> Some of your abilities grant you and your allies Supercharged. This effect grants the following bonuses:
                  <ul class="normalText">
                    <li>Increased movement speed</li>
                    <li>Increased attack speed, allowing exceeding the attack speed cap</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="normalText">These bonuses last 3s. Landing a basic attack on an enemy champion resets the duration to a minimum of 2s.</div>
                  <br>
                  <div class="normalText">When you are empowered with Supercharged, you are unable to gain Charge but gain the benefits of Draining Touch on every basic attack in addition to the buffs listed above.</div>
              </p>

              <h3 class="subHeader">Q - Siphon / Displace [Alternate Recast: Warp Strike]</h3>
              <p class="normalText">
                <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A bit of damage, but more importantly a way to generate Charge. The tether portion provides some interaction with enemies after the initial skillshot lands — enemies either allow themselves to be zoned for the duration or give the support Charge, which could potentially give them access to Supercharge. One awkward thing about this ability is that Charge is useless until you actually unlock your W, which is somewhat unfortunate. However, it does create an interesting choice on which ability to start the game with; starting W allows for Supercharge, but makes it difficult to build Charge. Starting Q allows building Charge which can be expended once the W is unlocked. Starting E could also be worthwhile for catching enemies or blocking high-value skillshots."><u>Siphon:</u></mark> Throw out a skillshot which pierces minions but stops at the first enemy champion hit. On hit, you gain 1 Charge and the target takes damage and is tethered for 2s. During that time, you can access to Displace. If the tether persists until the end of the duration, you gain an additional 1 Charge.

                <br><br><mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="This recast is a bit of peel and potentially engage rolled into one. Using it comes at the price of not getting the additional Charge from letting the tether expire, so its unwise to do so if the followup doesn't provide tangible value. The displacement, while short and brief, could allow for combos (such as with E), disruption, or slight peel for a vulnerable ally. We also have it apply the Mark from Draining Touch to give the kit a sense of cohesion and provide more benefits to using the recast."><u>Displace:</u></mark> Pull the tethered target a short distance towards your cursor, applying Draining Touch's Mark, and ending the tether immediately.

                <br><br><mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="This was the original idea I had for the Q recast. It's undoubtedly powerful, and likely far too much so when combined with the E. While it would likely feel great to use, I'd prefer the power budget be spent elsewhere (like on Supercharge) than on an ability that just catches enemies out with relatively little counterplay."><u>[Alternate] Warp Strike:</u></mark> An alternate ability to replace Displace. Blink behind the tethered champion, slowing them and applying Draining Touch's mark. Using this effect greatly increases the cooldown of this ability.

                <br><br><i>Cooldown: Low-Moderate (Roughly 14-8s)
                <br>Mana Cost: Low-Moderate</i>

              <h3 class="subHeader">W - Surge [Alternate: Reinforce]</h3>
              <p class="normalText">
                <mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A simple shield ability, but also the most reliable way to apply Supercharged. Ideally, we want this to present the player with a decision on when to use the shield: using it early may be necessary in some situations, but ideally you want to use it when at full Charge. The fact that using the ability consumes all Charge allows enemies to force its usage and prevent Supercharged, though the support at least gets a stronger shield as consolation. On the flip side, getting to full charge and then using this ability gives a powerful shield alongside a powerful buff, making it a very potent tool when comitting to an engagement."><u>Surge:</u></mark> Consume all Charge and grant the target ally and yourself a shield. The strength of the shield is increased for each unit of Charge consumed.

                If 4 units of Charge are consumed, the target ally and yourself are Supercharged.

                <br><br><i>Cooldown: Low-Moderate (Roughly 12-8s)
                <br>Mana Cost: Moderate</i>

                <br><br><mark data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A much more substantial ability than Surge, with both a mobility and crowd control component. I much prefer this ability conceptually, though it's certainly arguable that it adds too much to an already loaded kit. My original idea for Surge was to have a very simple ability to balance out the relative wordiness and complexity in the Passive and Q, but Reinforce also mostly fits that bill, just with more power baked in. I prefer this ability because I feel it fits better with the rest of the kit — a random shield ability feels somewhat out of place amongst crowd control and other high impact gameplay."><u>[Alternate] Reinforce:</u></mark> Dash to the target ally champion and perform a circular sweep shortly afterwards which damages enemies and knocks them back a short distance. You can target yourself with this ability to perform the sweep at your current location. Casting Rush or United Charge during the dash or sweep cancels the sweep and immediately performs that ability instead.
                
                <br>If you have 4 Charge, all Charge is consumed to instead cast Empowered Reinforce. You also cast Empowered Reinforce if you are Supercharged at the time of casting, though doing so does not refresh the duration of Supercharge.

                <br><u>Empowered Reinforce:</u> Dash to the target ally champion and create a powerful blast which damages and knocks away nearby enemies, stunning them for a short time. You and the target ally then become Supercharged. If you targeted yourself with this ability, only you become Supercharged.

                Select a location and charge at a moderate pace towards it, destroying projectiles which hit you from the front during the charge. Enemy champions hit during the charge take damage and are slowed significantly. The dash ends upon hitting a wall. If you are Supercharged at the time of casting, instead cast Empowered Rush.

              <p class="normalText">
                Hold down the cast button to charge for up to 3s, then release to perform a dash towards the cursor, carrying the closest ally within a short range with you. The range of the dash increases over the first 1.5s of charging. Both you and the carried ally are untargetable during the dash.
                
                <br><br>If the dash hits an enemy champion, it stops immediately and creates an explosion which damages nearby enemies. After the dash, both you and the carried ally are Supercharged if you end the dash near at least one enemy champion. If you were already Supercharged, the duration is instead refreshed.
